# About Me
---

I'm a recent graduate of UIUC's MCS Master's program of Computer Science with a keen interest in software development with a focus in data-heavy fields like machine learning, data science, and database systems. Throughout my education, I've gained a variety of skills and experiences that bolstered my software development, leadership, and presentation skills that let me tackle the toughest challenges.
